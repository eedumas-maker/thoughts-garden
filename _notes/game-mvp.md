title: What's my Minimum Viable Product?
---

I'd like to make a game, but choosing how to start is such a challenge. I already have about a dozen or so partially started versions of the same thing, but usually get a roadblock that inevitably leaves me unmotivated. However, maybe this time it'll be different.

[Reading this wonderful article](https://gamedevbeginner.com/how-to-start-making-a-game-a-guide-to-planning-your-first-project/) on how to plan your game (I highly recommend this site for so many well written game design tutorials, mostly Unity focused but not always) I learned about a Minimum Viable Product, a fancy way of saying "just enough of a prototype to get the gist of it."

So what's my MVP for my cleaning-bot game? I'm starting with this idea:
- You move around, picking up objects, to raise the appreciation level of an NPC

What will it need?
- An object to be the player
- Some objects to be pickupable
- An indicator of how many objects are picked up out of a set total
- A "thank you" message when you're done to show end of demo
- One room with walls to contain you

What won't it need?
- Artwork
- Sounds
- Music
- Background details
- Crafting or Upgrading system

If it's not fun, how to make it fun?
- Add in a variety of other tasks, simple tasks, that raise different NPC's appreciation levels
- The objects you pick up make you go faster for a set amount of time
-
