title: Share your ideas, they are seeds! ðŸŒ±

I like ideas and I want to see how they grow. An idea, once shared, can grow, wither, be pruned, fed, and ultimately live on its own. I'm not attached to many of my ideas, and I share them in hopes to find community, or find challenge to grow as a person.

This digital garden is just a place for such idea-seeds. 

I believe everyone deserves to share their experience, and everyone benefits from being understood. When you share it helps me know you and myself, and it's good thing all around. There's [[The trouble with winning vs losing language ðŸŒ±|no winning or losing]] when it comes to sharing our ideas, because either we'll grow from having our ideas challenged, or find community in those that share similar ideas.
