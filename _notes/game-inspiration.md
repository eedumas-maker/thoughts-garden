title: So much inspiration

I grew up playing so many games, from the awesome bootleg floppies on our Apple IIgs, to the amazing vector graphics of the Vectrex. The one system that really left an impression on me was our Mac Plus. 

This book, "The Secret History of Mac Gaming" was a wonderful journey through both nostalgia and games developers that were just goofing around and ended up making my childhood so much happier.
