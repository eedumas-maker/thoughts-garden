I'm learning how to make a game, and at the same time learning how to learn to make a game.

I approached the problem like anyone starting a new skill set, thinking it would be quick and easy. I had a 20 year old CS degree I hadn't used, and a vast experience playing games, so I was full of hubris.

Turns out it's messy. There's a lot to learn, and a lot to try out. 

Here's a glimpse into my process, it started with scraps of paper, then/still various notebooks, and now the addition of digital work. Dreaming up mechanics, theme, story, art all made me think I was progressing on a game, but I also often lost sight of what makes games fun.

Thankfully this digital garden will let me show my progress, my fits and starts, and any little successes and lessons I go through.
