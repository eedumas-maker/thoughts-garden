title: Let's Grow Together 🌱

This post is a Seedling 🌱, as I'm starting with a little idea and hoping it will grow into something beautiful.

Therapy is great, it saved my life and many others, but it has its limitations. One benefit of therapy is called "normalization" and that's where a professional tells you you're not crazy because they've heard the same story/insecurity/fear and whatever.

I want to tell you you're not crazy without you having to be my client. 

We're all humans, in our insecurities, fears, worries, and funky unique habits. Unfortunately we often think we're alone in this, and in general we don't do so well when we start to feel lonely, isolated, or unloved.

Being human is nothing to be ashamed of, and I wanted to change my podcast to make it a space to anonymously share these things so we can all realize our humanity connects us.

Being human is enough, and you're not alone in whatever you're going through. Don't take my word for it, submit your own question, worry, concern, insecurity and we'll all grow together.
