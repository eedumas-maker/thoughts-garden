title: I'm learning to code!
---



Fun fact, I was getting a computer science degree right as the dot-com bubble burst around 2000. I had thought it could get me a job, and while coding was fascinating I never really paid attention enough to get into it. I switched to psychology, and have been bouncing back and forth between the two ever since.

Now it's high time I get back into coding. Programming is the modern magic, few understand it, and those that do are in a separate world from the rest of us. You push buttons and new things happen. You enter the liminal space between electricity and reality, mediated by a dazzling variety of machines and circuits.

It's also clunky, messy, constantly shifting, and often used to make a simple process more complex, or at the whim of someone who has more money than design sense. Or so I hear.

So in the interest of transparency, here's my journey in learning to code in my 40's.

I've been really enjoying this book, the [C# Player's Guide](http://csharpplayersguide.com). It's a playful journey to learn the C# language, in the style of an adventure in a fictional realm. It even has a map and has you track your XP as you do coding exercises! I'm a quarter of the way through but it's been very satisfying.

I've looked at local bootcamps, notably [Alchemy Code Lab](https://www.alchemycodelab.com) but the price was too high.

Now I'm considering [The Odin Project](http://theodinproject.com). It's an open-source project to help you become a web developer (there's so many flavors of what type of programmer you can be) but lets you pick between Ruby on Rails and Javascript. Back in 2000 I was learning Javascript so I think I'll pick that path, once I brush up on HTML, CSS, and more foundational learning. Plus it's free!
