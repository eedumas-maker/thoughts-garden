There's good parts to the concept of professionalism, like pride in our work and doing our best, but there's parts that gross me out too, like cold interactions, and the idea that "it's just business" to rationalize the idea that it's best practice to act without feeling or a sense of humanity.

There's not a lot of room for forgiveness in the modern idea of professionalism, and I'd like to see that change.
