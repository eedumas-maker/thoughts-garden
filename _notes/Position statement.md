ðŸŒ±[^1]
In this note I hope to give you some background on me, to give some context about where my ideas come from.

At this time of writing I'm a mid 40's white cis-gendered male (though I've been exploring my distaste with masculinity, and haven't reached any settled conclusions), my sexuality fluctuates (thanks SSRIs ðŸ‘Ž), and I've got a few bits of flair to manage (ASD, ADHD, depression, long-covid). 
My educational background is in psychology, computer science, and a masters in mental health counseling, but I have so much to learn about living and making this world better.
I identify as an anarchist (not the violent stereotype, but being hopeful in our capacity to self organize and be good to one another), and anti-capitalist (as I believe power corrupts).
