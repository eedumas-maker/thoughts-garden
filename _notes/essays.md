title: Writing is a Joy/Sorrow
---

I love writing, and yet I don't write often. Looking in the mirror is challenging, and writing has always felt like the most challenging mirror. But it also feels good afterward, so maybe this exercise is worth it.

I'm working on a few essays and little one-page short stories.
- Money is a Curse: How the cultural concept of money has caused more harm than good
- The Blood Sewer (a short story)
