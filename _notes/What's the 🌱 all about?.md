Basically the little emojis show the status and scope of an idea!

Here's my current thoughts on how they could flow:
- 🌰 seed: The newest idea, barely more than a concept
- 🌱 sprout: An idea exploring it's potential, but still young
- 🪴 potted plant: An established idea I'm tending
- 🌳 tree: An old idea that can weather the seasons
- 🍂 fallen leaves: An idea that I'm not into any more, but keep around to show that not everything works out.

One thing that kept me from writing was the sense that it needed to be a finished perfect product. But with a digital garden I can share seeds, sprouts, saplings, and plants of all ages! So you'll see these icons after every note, and if I update something you'll see the emoji change.
