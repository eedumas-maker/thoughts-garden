This is my digital garden, a place to grow my ideas.

So what are the projects I'm working on? Check 'em out below!

[[coding|I'm learning to code!]] - I'm learning to program, it's like magic.

[[game|I'm learning to make games]] - My latest note is an attempt to make a [[game-mvp|Minimum Viable Product]]

[[despair|I want to rebrand despair]]

[[essays|I'm writing?]] - My latest bit of writing is [[relearning|The emotional challenges of learning to code]]

As you can tell, I dig the old Mac OS 6/7 look. All art made in either [CloudPaint](https://www.cloudpaint.com/imageeditor) or [KidPix](https://kidpix.app/)
- Update: Sadly it seems that CloudPaint is down, but this new webapp [System7](https://system7.app/) looks promising as a replacement!
