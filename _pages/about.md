I've been many things (therapist, perfumer, presenter, dishwasher) but throughout all of them I've had a desire to make peoples lives just a little less stressful. This is a place for me to explore my ideas, give my perspectives, and expand on topics that come up if you've ever had a conversation with me. If you haven't, reach out and let's chat!

To make this wonderful garden I enlisted the help of my friend NÃ­m, [check out his garden here](https://digigarden.onrender.com/). I also used Github, Jekyll (a way to make a blog using Github), and this wonderful text editing app called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

All art made in either [KidPix](https://kidpix.app/) or an emulated Mac Paint through [System7](https://system7.app/).
